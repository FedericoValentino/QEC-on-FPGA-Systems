# QEC on FPGA Based Systems

Quantum computing is a promising paradigm where the computation adopts quantum mechanics instead of binary algebra. However, quantum computers suffer a significant drawback from a reliability perspective. Thus, quantum error correction (QEC) is the primary way to mitigate such effects, correct that error, and offer improved reliability. Especially, QEC demands high-speed and low-latency computations close to the quantum systems. Therefore, accelerating QEC on FPGAs represents one of the most exciting ways of the research panorama. This project aims at implementing QEC on high-performance FPGAs.
